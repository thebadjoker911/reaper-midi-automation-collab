# Real-Time Reaper MIDI & Automation Collaboration System

## Project Context
I have an existing repository with basic device-to-device RPP file synchronization for Reaper DAW. I want to extend this to create a real-time collaborative editing system specifically for MIDI data and automation envelopes - similar to how Google Docs handles collaborative text editing.

## Technical Foundation Already Available
- Basic RPP file synchronization between devices
- Understanding that RPP files store MIDI and automation data in human-readable text format
- Cross-platform file monitoring capabilities

## Technical Requirements
- Selective RPP parser for MIDI and automation
- Real-time change detection and serialization
- WebSocket communication for data exchange
- Operational Transform conflict resolution algorithms
- ReaScript integration with Reaper API

## Goals
Enable two or more users to collaboratively edit MIDI and automation in real time, with low latency and cross-platform support.

## Development Phases
1. Core Parsing & Detection
2. Network Layer
3. ReaScript Integration
4. Conflict Resolution & Testing
