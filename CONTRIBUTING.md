# Contributing to Reaper MIDI & Automation Collaboration System

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/reaper-midi-automation-collab.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use ESLint to maintain code quality. Before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Our ESLint configuration enforces:
- 2-space indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- Unix line endings

### Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ parser/           # RPP file parsing logic
â”œâ”€â”€ server/           # WebSocket server implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ client/           # WebSocket client implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/            # Shared utilities (file monitoring, OT)
â”œâ”€â”€ reascript/        # Lua scripts for Reaper integration
â””â”€â”€ index.js          # Main entry point
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Parser Enhancements**
   - Add new parsing logic to `src/parser/rpp-parser.js`
   - Update extraction methods if needed
   - Test with sample RPP files

2. **Server Features**
   - Extend `src/server/websocket-server.js`
   - Add new message types to the protocol
   - Update message handling

3. **Client Features**
   - Extend `src/client/websocket-client.js`
   - Add new event emitters
   - Update connection logic

4. **Operational Transform**
   - Enhance `src/utils/operational-transform.js`
   - Add new operation types
   - Implement transform logic

### Testing

Currently, the project uses manual testing. When adding features:

1. Test with the example scripts
2. Verify with multiple clients
3. Check edge cases and error handling

**Future**: We plan to add automated tests using Jest or Mocha.

### Documentation

Update documentation when adding features:

- **API Changes**: Update `docs/API.md`
- **Setup Changes**: Update `docs/SETUP.md`
- **Architecture Changes**: Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **New Examples**: Add to `examples/` with README
